# AGENTS.md — WrkstrmKit Release Naming 🎨🖋️📦

## Purpose 🌟📐🗂️

This document provides an expanded and rigorously articulated framework for defining a coherent,
extensible, and brand-aligned nomenclature schema for WrkstrmKit releases. It serves as a definitive
reference for both human agents and automated systems, ensuring consistent production, validation,
and dissemination of release identifiers, notes, tags, and associated artifacts across the full
spectrum of the software lifecycle. By codifying a uniform methodology, this framework strengthens
brand identity, streamlines collaboration, and reduces cognitive overhead when communicating version
details across diverse teams and contexts. ✨📝📢

## Naming Convention (Authoritative) 🎯🎨📏

The release naming convention prescribes that each designation shall begin with the semantic version
number (in full `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format), followed by a typographic space, a hyphen, another
space, and then a carefully chosen _Color_ and _Design Term_. This structured approach creates a
unique, human-readable label that encapsulates both the technical identity of the release and an
evocative descriptor. 🎨🔢🖋️

**Format:**

```
<semver> - <Color> <DesignTerm>
```

**Examples:**

```
1.0.1 - Cerulean Baseline
1.1.0 - Crimson Grid
1.2.0 - Slate Kerning
1.3.0 - Amber Alignment
2.0.0 - Ivory Golden Ratio
```

The chosen descriptors must be memorable yet disciplined, fostering intuitive association while
preserving semantic clarity across multiple release cycles.

## Components 🧩🎨📐

- **Version (SemVer):** Presented as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, each component carries explicit meaning
  grounded in API stability semantics. 🔢📊📌
  - **MAJOR:** Indicates substantial, non-backward-compatible changes to the public API or
    architectural foundations. 💥⚡🚫
  - **MINOR:** Represents the introduction of new features or enhancements that retain full backward
    compatibility. ✨📈🆕
  - **PATCH:** Captures incremental improvements, including defect remediation, documentation
    enrichment, and additional test coverage, all without altering public API contracts. 🛠️📚✅
- **Color:** A chromatic reference, perceptible and easily distinguished, chosen to evoke an
  emotional or thematic resonance while differentiating releases. 🎨🌈🖌️
- **Design Term:** A conceptual or functional UI/UX term, rooted in SwiftUI/UIKit practice,
  reflecting the release's contribution to layout, typographic precision, interactivity, or
  aesthetic refinement. 🖋️📐🖼️

## Approved Vocabularies 📚🎨🖋️

Only select descriptors from the vetted inventories herein, expanding them judiciously to maintain
thematic cohesion and prevent dilution of brand semantics. The curation process should be documented
and deliberate, with each addition justified on grounds of recognizability and relevance. 📝🎯🌈

> **Guideline:** Prioritize concise, widely understood terminology to ensure accessibility for
> multidisciplinary teams, avoiding esotericism that could obscure meaning. 📏📚🖋️

## Rules & Edge Cases 📜⚖️🔍

1. **Uniqueness:** The combination of Color and Design Term must remain unique across the entire
   project history; in case of conflict, alter one or both components to preserve distinction.
   🚫♻️🔑
2. **Title Case:** Each significant word in both the Color and Design Term must begin with an
   uppercase letter for typographic consistency. 🔠✏️📏
3. **ASCII Only:** Limit characters in the codename to ASCII to ensure compatibility across diverse
   systems and tooling pipelines. 💻📜🛡️
4. **Pre-Releases:** Maintain codename integrity for beta and release-candidate builds, appending
   standardized SemVer labels. 🧪📦🔖
   - `1.2.0-beta.1 - Slate Kerning` 🧪✏️📄
   - `2.0.0-rc.2 - Ivory Golden Ratio` 🧪📏🖼️
5. **Hotfixes:** Preserve the codename of the immediate MINOR version for any subsequent PATCH that
   solely addresses defects or documentation. 🛠️📚✅
6. **Documentation-Only:** Even releases confined to documentation or non-functional changes shall
   receive a full codename. 📚📝✅
7. **Reserved Words:** Avoid terms that may overlap with branch names, system UI themes, or other
   operational identifiers. 🚫🖥️⚠️

## Release Process Checklist (for Agents) ✅📋🛠️

1. Identify the appropriate SemVer increment with reference to the scope of change. 🔢📊🛠️
2. Select a Color and Design Term pair that has not been previously used and aligns with thematic
   intent. 🎨🖋️🔍
3. Construct the formal release designation according to the prescribed format. 🏷️📜🖋️
4. Integrate the designation into all release artifacts: 📂📝🔗
   - `CHANGELOG.md` section header 📄🖋️✅
   - Git tag for the release 🏷️💻📌
   - GitHub Release title 🖥️📜🖋️
   - Public communications including blogs, newsletters, and social media posts 📢📰🌐
5. Verify the accuracy of hyperlinks and version references across all materials. 🔗🔍✅
6. Execute continuous integration validations to enforce format correctness and ensure absence of
   duplication. 🛠️✅📊

## Automation 🤖⚙️📡

Automation may be deployed to both generate and verify codenames. This ensures procedural
compliance, reduces the likelihood of human error, and accelerates the release pipeline. 🛠️📜🚀

### Name Generation (Deterministic Option)

- Input parameters: version string, curated Color list, curated Design Term list 🎨🖋️📋
- Algorithm: Select the first lexicographically available combination that has not been used
  previously. 🔢📏✅

### Name Generation (Random Option)

- Method: Use the Git tag, commit hash, or diff digest as a deterministic randomization seed,
  producing consistent yet unpredictable pairings for given code states. 🎲🔐📜

### Validation Hooks

- CI pipelines must enforce regex pattern compliance for all release titles: 🔍📜✅

  ```
  ^\d+\.\d+\.\d+\s-\s[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+\s[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+(\s[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+)?$
  ```

- Implement a historical check against `.release-names.json` to detect reuse. 📚✅🔒

### Suggested Repository Files

- `.release-names.json`: a machine-readable archive documenting all prior release names with
  associated metadata. 🗂️📜🕒
- `Scripts/generate_release_name.swift`: a CLI utility to assist maintainers in generating and
  validating new codenames. 🖥️📜🛠️

## Style in Docs & Announcements ✍️📢📚

- **Initial Reference:** Always state the complete release designation in its canonical form on
  first mention. 🖋️📜✅
- **Subsequent References:** Once context is established, the codename alone may be used to
  facilitate brevity. 🔄🖋️📏
- **Typography:** Ensure consistent punctuation and spacing, with a single space on either side of
  the hyphen. 📏🖋️✅

## Governance 🏛️📋⚙️

- The designated release authority or maintainer approves all final naming decisions, ensuring
  adherence to this specification. 🧑‍✈️📜✅
- Any proposal to expand the approved vocabularies must include rationale, examples, and a review
  for thematic integrity. 📄📝✅

## FAQ ❓📚💡

**Q:** Can multiple design terms be combined into a single codename?\
**A:** This practice is discouraged. If unavoidable, employ a compound term that conveys a singular,
cohesive concept. 📏🖋️✅

**Q:** What is the protocol if the approved vocabulary is exhausted?\
**A:** Extend the lexicon with terms of high recognizability and relevance, avoiding obscure,
domain-specific, or proprietary expressions. 🎨📚⚠️

**Q:** Are there any scenarios in which the codename can be omitted?\
**A:** No. The consistent use of a codename enhances recall and reinforces brand identity across the
release timeline. 📜🔍✅
